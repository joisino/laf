# Training-free Graph Neural Networks and the Power of Labels as Features (TMLR 2024)

[![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2404.19288-b31b1b.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19288)

We propose training-free graph neural networks (TFGNNs), which can be used without training and can also be improved with optional training.
